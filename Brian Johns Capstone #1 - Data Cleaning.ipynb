    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "It is the goal of every team in the National Hockey League (NHL) to build a team that will eventually win the Stanley Cup.  However, the business part of the league restricts how money is spread to the players in order to maintain competitive balance across the league.  For the 2021-22 season, the main restrictions are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- All teams must have **20-23 active players** on the roster.\n",
    "\n",
    "- No team is allowed to spend more than **$81.5 million total** on their active players.  This is the Salary Cap for each team.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The maximum salary for any player is **$16.3 million**\n",
    "\n",
    "- For rookies, they sign an 'entry-level' contract after they are drafted.  The maximum entry-level contract is **$925,000** for the first 3 years of their contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The minimum salary for any player is **$700,000**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The amount of money a player counts against the Salary Cap for their team is determined by the **average salary across the full duration of their contract**.  This is a player's 'Cap Hit'.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to evaluate talent within the league, the use of advanced analytics has become more popular in the last 10 years.  The amount of statistical information about the players in the league is immense, giving a team who can effectively use this data an advantage in player acquisition and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the information about players has changed and grown, I am curious to see if it has had an effect on team building strategies in the NHL.  The question I would like to answer is:\n",
    "\n",
    "**How can we predict and evaluate the Cap Hit of NHL players using their basic and advanced statistics?**\n",
    "\n",
    "If I am able to do this, I would be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify statistics that players are currently being rewarded for.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Identify statistics that may be undervalued and could be gaps in the market for players.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Identify players that are under/overvalued based on their performance profile."

    "I will be retieving data from two primary sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Financial Statistics are from [CapFriendly](https://www.capfriendly.com/).\n",

    "\n",
    "    - The only statistics that are free to view on Evolving Hockey are the basic statistics which can be found here: [Skater Tables](https://evolving-hockey.com/stats/skater_standard/)\n",
    "\n",
    "The more advanced statistics, and the ability to download the information, requires a subscription to the site.  I had a previous subscription so I have downloaded all of the data into 8 separate csv files.\n",
    "\n",
    "From here, the goals for this notebook will be to:\n",
    "1. [Data Wrangling](#wrangling) - Effectively upload the data from each source into separate dataframes\n",
    "2. [Merging Data](#merging) - Do some initial data cleaning and formatting in order to merge the separate dataframes together\n",
    "3. [Data Cleaning](#cleaning) - After merging the data, finish cleaning the data in order to maximize the amount of data available for analysis"
